Hello! Thank you for attention on my test task!
On the left side of screen you can see a form, where you can put all data about bought products and after clicking on the button "Add" this product will appear in the list on the right side of the screen! Over this list you can see buttons. "Clear All" remove all product from your list, "Remove" - you can delete product one by one by hand, "Remove all:" - you have to choose a currency, product bought for this currency will be remove from list and button "Remove all product by:" - you need to choose a date, and product bought in this day will be delete. Under list, you can see a block "Total amount", which show how much money you spent in PLN.
